full crud with one to many functionality
could not figure out how to bring the static style files into express

functional flow

go to localhost-> create a few wines
each wine is associated to comments so multiple comments are connected to each wine
you can edit and delete comments as needed by following the flow.

app can through a weird erros sometimes best course of action is to 

CAREFULLY comment out all the get and post requests then
run server
stop server
uncomment some get and post
run server
test flow
stop server
uncommit the rest. 

it all works just looks ugly. but thats what the wine is for
